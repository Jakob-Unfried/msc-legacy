Code developed during the course of my masters thesis.
This is a legacy version and reflects the version that was used for the numerical data in the thesis.


## Not included 
(to avoid licensing / plagiarism issues)
- utils/jax_utils/ncon_jax.py

  This is an adaption of ncon.py shipped with [TensorTrace](tensortrace.org) to use `jax.numpy` as a backend.
  Happy to provide pointers on how to do this on request.
- figures/linear_pred.py
